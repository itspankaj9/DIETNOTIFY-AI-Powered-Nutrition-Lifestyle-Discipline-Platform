# 🚀 Project Kickoff: DietNotify - Day 1 Update

I’m thrilled to announce the start of my new AI project: **DietNotify** – an intelligent Nutrition & Lifestyle Assistant designed to help you live healthier! 🥗✨

### 🌟 The Vision
DietNotify isn't just a calorie counter. It's an AI-powered companion that will eventually offer:
*   **Smart Alerts** for meal timings and hydration.
*   **Lifestyle Tracking** to monitor habits and health goals.
*   **Personalized Insights** derived from accurate nutritional data.

### 📅 Day 1: Laying the Foundation (The Nutrition Engine)

You can't build a smart assistant without accurate data. So, for **Day 1**, I focused on building the core **Nutrition Search Engine**.

**What I accomplished:**
1.  **Unified Knowledge Base**: Processed and merged massive datasets into a single, optimized library of over 2,000 verified food items.
2.  **Precision Search Tool**: Built a Python-based engine (`nutrition_search.py`) that retrieves *exact* nutritional breakdowns (Calories, Protein, Vitamins) in standard units.
3.  **Solving Ambiguity**: Implemented a "Smart Selection" system. If you ask for "Pizza," it doesn't guess—it lets you specify "Pepperoni," "Cheese," or "Dominos," ensuring the data you get is 100% real.

### 🔜 What's Next?
Now that the data layer is solid, I'll be moving on to the **Intelligence Layer**—building the logic that turns these numbers into actionable advice!

Follow along as I build DietNotify from scratch! 💻🚀
